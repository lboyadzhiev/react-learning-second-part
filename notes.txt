Portals

    Portals need two things, a place we want to put the component, and then need to let the component know.

    In index.html we make a div with some id

Refs
    They allow us access to other DOM elements and work with them. Whit Refs we can set up a connection between HTML element which is been rendered in the end and our other JS code.

    It takes a default value that we want to initialized to. Returns a value which allows to wokr with that value later. But we are receiving the exact node value from the DOM.

    If we use Refs we talk about uncontrolled components, why uncontrolled, because the internal state is not controlled by React.
